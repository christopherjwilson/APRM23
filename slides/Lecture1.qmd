## Overview

There are many ongoing discussions in clinical psychology research. They will be picked up in other sessions this year. Today we will discuss:

- Translating research into effective treatment

- Cinical analogue studies

- Open and reproducable research

## Research designs in clinical psychology

 
- A wide range of approaches are commonly used: Experimental and quasi-experimental,  correlational, case study, and qualitative designs. 
 
- To investigate psychological disorders, assessment, treatment, prevention, professional training, ethics, and cultural diversity.

## Types of psychopathology research

## Experimental psychopathology research example {.smaller}

@PetersEtAl2011 employed an experimental approach to test the hypothesis that attributional style may be one causative factor of depression vulnerability.

-   Undergraduate students, without a history of depression, were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions: resilience condition or vulnerability condition

-   The resiliency condition involved exposing participants to 60 descriptions that promoted a selfworthy, stable attribution of a positive event and 60 descriptions that promoted an unstable attribution unrelated to self-worth for a negative event.

-   The vulnerability condition involved exposing participants to 60 descriptions that promoted a self-deﬁcient, stable attribution of a negative event and 60 descriptions that promoted an unstable attribution unrelated to self-worth for a positive event.

-   Following exposure to the assigned descriptions, all participants subsequently completed a stressor task (i.e., Cognitive Ability Test).

-   Peters and colleagues measured the change in mood state from before to after manipulation.

-   Results indicated that individuals in the resilience condition reported less depressed mood (compared to the vulnerability condition) in response to the academic stressor

## Experimental psychopathology research

Sometimes referred to as "Type 1" clinical research [@ComerKendall2013]

-   Able to identify putative causal variables that are directly manipulable (i.e., How or why might psychopathology develop?).

-   May serve as the "building blocks" of future intervention eﬀorts.

-   Rarely followed through to the point of application.

## Quasi experimental research example 

@FelminghamEtAl2010 recorded functional magnetic resonance imaging data in both male and female participants with a diagnosis of PTSD.

-   Trauma-exposed controls, and non-- trauma-exposed controls while they viewed masked facial expressions of fear.

-   By examining neural activation to threat, Felmingham and colleagues sought to elucidate one of the possible pathways through which women have a greater propensity than men to develop PTSD following trauma.

-   Findings indicated that exposure to trauma was associated with enhanced brainstem activity to fear in women, regardless of the presence of PTSD; however, in men, brainstem activity was associated only with the development of PTSD.

-   Moreover, men with PTSD (compared to women) displayed greater hippocampal activity to fear, possibly suggesting that men have an enhanced capacity for contextualizing fear-related stimuli

## Quasi experimental psychopathology research

Sometimes referred to as "Type II" clinical research [@ComerKendall2013]

-   Type II research can help identify independent variables that exacerbate, or modify the expression of, existing forms of abnormal behavior

-   Cannot to answer causal questions about the development of psychopathology due to pre-existence in sample and interaction with so many other variables

    -   Diagnosis is a summary of cumulative history but said history cannot be used to infer what caused diagnosis

-   If the IV is a clinical intervention, then could examine variables that either prevent or ameliorate psychopathology
