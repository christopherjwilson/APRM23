# Clinical Analogue Studies

## What are clinical analogue studies?

- Clinical analogue studies are studies that use non-clinical samples to study processes related to psychopathology.

    - For example: The role of attention in PTSD
    - Is this a form of attentional bias towrds threat stimuli or an inability to disengage from threat stimuli?

- They allow us to study processes related to psychopathology in a controlled environment.

- They allow specific variables to be manipulated to identify mechanisms of change.

## Why use clinical analogue studies? #1

- Research with clinical groups is often correlational which does not allow drawing conclusions about what causation.

- The use of experimental designs with clinical population can be ethically problematic, as exposure to stimuli (e.g., stressors) to measure "in the moment" effects, could be traumatic.

- Retrospective reports lack objective information about external stumuli or order of events.

## Why use clinical analogue studies? #2

- Subclinical measurements can allow accurate modelling of relevant processes (e.g. Depression: @HillEtAl1987). 

- Allows design of studies to better understand the relationship between:
    - treatment -> process  
    - process -> outcome 

[@EhringEtAl2022]

- Allows control and focus on specific variables to identify mechanisms of change [@EhringEtAl2022]

## Clinical relevance of analogue studies

-  "the nature and intensity of the target problem, not the clinical status of the subjects, are the critical variables in analogue research" (e.g., fear and phobias: @BorkovecRachman1979, p. 253).

- Basic research has helped identify etiological factors in the development of many disorders (e.g. OCD: @Gibbs1996)

- Symptoms can be prevalent in non-clinical populations, with similar qualitative expressions of experience and similar causal and maintenance factors [@AbramowitzEtAl2014, @AbramowitzEtAl2001, @PuckettEtAl]

## Limitations of clinical analogue studies? #1

Potential issues with clinical analogue studies include:

- Ecological validity: the extent to which the findings of a research study are able to be generalized to real-life settings.

- External validity: the extent to which the findings of a research study are able to be generalized to other people, settings, and times.

- Comorbidity: the presence of one or more additional disorders (or diseases) co-occurring with a primary disorder or disease.

## Limitations of clinical analogue studies? #2

However, it has been argued that the limitations of clinical analogue studies are often overstated [@AbramowitzEtAl2014] and that the weaknesses of clinical analogue studies are often shared with clinical studies (i.e. poor research is poor research, regardless of the sample):

- Lack of sufficient power in studies
- Reliance on findings from single studies that have yet to be replicated
- Weakness in research designs
- Over-reliance on or misunderstanding of NHST
- Diagnostic unreliability
- Selective reporting of results
