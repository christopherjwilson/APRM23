# Research Designs in Clinical Psychology {.unnumbered}

## At the end of this session, you will be able to:

- Describe a range of research apporaches used in clinical psychology
- Critically discuss some of the limitations of clinical psychology research identified in the literature
- Consider and apply some approaches that are suggested for the for development of more robust research practices

Clinical psychology research employs a variety of designs to investigate questions about psychological disorders, assessment, treatment, and professional issues (Kazdin 2021). Experimental designs like randomized controlled trials are considered the "gold standard" for determining treatment efficacy (Blampied 1998). These large-scale studies with hundreds of participants are increasingly common in clinical research (Blampied 1998). However, early phase studies often lack adequate power and instead use small "pilot" studies to estimate effect sizes for larger trials (Epstein 2021). 

Single-case designs offer an alternative for early translational research. Reversal and multiple baseline designs can test intervention effects and determine sample sizes for randomized trials (Epstein 2021). These flexible, efficient designs suit the experimental nature of clinical psychology (Sanderson 1991).

Clinical research also employs quasi-experimental designs, correlational analyses, case studies, and qualitative methods (Kazdin 2021; Kendall 1982; Roberts 2003). Assessment research uses psychometrics to develop and validate measures (Kendall 1982). Prevention research tests interventions to reduce disorder risk factors (Kendall 1982). Studies on professional issues like training and ethics are also common (Roberts 2003).

Cultural diversity issues must be addressed when researching ethnic minority groups (Kendall 1982). Research with children, adolescents, older adults, couples, and families requires specialized methods (Kendall 1982; Roberts 2003). 

In summary, clinical psychology employs diverse research designs, from small-scale studies to large randomized controlled trials, to investigate psychological disorders, assessment, treatment, prevention, professional training, ethics, and cultural diversity. Experimental and quasi-experimental methods are commonly used, as are correlational, case study, and qualitative designs (Kazdin 2021; Kendall 1982; Roberts 2003; Epstein 2021; Blampied 1998; Sanderson 1991).

## Research questions that are built on evidence
Build questions based on what we do know. Not based on assumptions about empty space.

## Research questions that are built on theory
If your questions are linked to existing theory, they should connect with other aspects of that theory.

## Research questions that are clear in what they want to achieve
Cause and effect can only be inferred from certain types of designs.

## Research that uses appropriate and valid methods to answer the research question

# Designing impactful research

# Designing ethical research









# Certain types of questions can be linked to certain types of analysis
Descriptive research
Can have value in certain applied settings if linked to theory and enhances our understanding of a phenomenon

# Relationships and predictions

# Experimental and quasi-experimental designs
Experimental study of psychopathology

# Regression approaches

# Moderated relationships

# Mediated relationships


the experimental study of pathological behavior (i.e., using the experimental method to study pre-existing pathological behavior), or the study of experimental pathological behavior (i.e., the pathological behavior being studied is induced experimentally rather than developed naturally)

## Definitions of psychopathology research

![](images/psychopathologyResearch.png)

[@theoxfo2013]

## Type 1: Experimental psychopathology research

-   Looking to understand how manipulating certain variables links with adaptive or maladaptive behaviour

-   Often non-clinical samples offer a "clean bio-behavioural history" for theory testing

-   Can establish a normative context for comparison with clinical populations

-   Not looking to develop a complete account of how psychopathology develops

## Example: Type 1 Experimental psychopathology research {.scrollable .smaller}

@peters2011 employed a Type I research paradigm to test the hypothesis that attributional style may be one causative factor of depression vulnerability.

-   Undergraduate students, without a history of depression, were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions: resilience condition or vulnerability condition

-   The resiliency condition involved exposing participants to 60 descriptions that promoted a selfworthy, stable attribution of a positive event and 60 descriptions that promoted an unstable attribution unrelated to self-worth for a negative event.

-   The vulnerability condition involved exposing participants to 60 descriptions that promoted a self-deﬁcient, stable attribution of a negative event and 60 descriptions that promoted an unstable attribution unrelated to self-worth for a positive event.

-   Following exposure to the assigned descriptions, all participants subsequently completed a stressor task (i.e., Cognitive Ability Test).

-   Peters and colleagues measured the change in mood state from before to after manipulation.

-   Results indicated that individuals in the resilience condition reported less depressed mood (compared to the vulnerability condition) in response to the academic stressor

## Type 1 Experimental psychopathology research

-   Able to identify putative causal variables that are directly manipulable (i.e., How or why might psychopathology develop?).

-   May serve as the "building blocks" of future intervention eﬀorts.

-   Rarely followed through to the point of application.

## Type 2 Quasi-experimental psychopathology research

-   As with Type 1: direct manipulation of independent variables and evaluation of their eﬀects on biobehavioral processes.

-   Sample with established psychopathology risk dimension or display subclinical (i.e., they do not reach a diagnostic threshold) features of psychopathology.

-   Cannot infer what causes psychopathology, as it has been selected into the sample.

::: notes
any resulting changes in behavior may be due to the interaction of the independent variable and a host of unknown variables and processes in persons so diagnosed. The result leaves the experimenter hypothesizing about why the changed independent variable functioned diﬀerentially in one patient sample compared to another.

## Example type 2 Quasi experimental psychopathology research {.scrollable .smaller}

@felmingham2010 recorded functional magnetic resonance imaging data in both male and female participants with a diagnosis of PTSD.

-   Trauma-exposed controls, and non-- trauma-exposed controls while they viewed masked facial expressions of fear.

-   By examining neural activation to threat, Felmingham and colleagues sought to elucidate one of the possible pathways through which women have a greater propensity than men to develop PTSD following trauma.

-   Findings indicated that exposure to trauma was associated with enhanced brainstem activity to fear in women, regardless of the presence of PTSD; however, in men, brainstem activity was associated only with the development of PTSD.

-   Moreover, men with PTSD (compared to women) displayed greater hippocampal activity to fear, possibly suggesting that men have an enhanced capacity for contextualizing fear-related stimuli

## Type 2 quasi experimental psychopathology research

-   Type II research can help identify independent variables that exacerbate, or modify the expression of, existing forms of abnormal behavior

-   Cannot to answer causal questions about the development of psychopathology due to pre-existence in sample and interaction with so many other variables

    -   Diagnosis is a summary of cumulative history but said history cannot be used to infer what caused diagnosis

-   If the IV is a clinical intervention, then could examine variables that either prevent or ameliorate psychopathology

## Type 3 Nonpatient psychopathology research

## Type 4
