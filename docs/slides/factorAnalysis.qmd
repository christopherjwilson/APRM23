## Overview

- What is factor analysis?

- Which research questions can factor analysis answer?

- What are the assumptions of factor analysis?

- How do we conduct factor analysis?

- How do we interpret factor analysis?

- How do we report factor analysis?

## What is factor analysis?

- Factor analysis is a statistical technique that is used to reduce a
  large number of variables to a smaller number of factors.

- It can be used in an exploratory or confirmatory manner.

- Factor analysis is also used as part of structural equation modelling (not covered here).

## Which research questions can factor analysis answer?

- Factor analysis is primarily used to identify latent variables (factors) that explain the relationships between observed variables.

- This approach can be applied to:

    1. Scale development in psychology (dimension reduction or data summarisation).
    2. Research questions involving latent variables.



## Scenario 1: Scale development

- A researcher is interested in developing a scale to measure
  "psychological wellbeing".

- They believe that psychological wellbeing is a latent variable which is indicated by a number of observed behaviours.

- They develop a questionnaire that initially measures 100 different behaviours.

- They then use factor analysis to identify the latent variables (i.e. dimensions of wellbeing) that explain the relationships between the observed behaviours.


## Scenario 2: Research questions involving latent variables {.smaller}

- A researcher wants to understand the factors that motivate people to seek help for mental health problems.

- Through researching the literature, they identify a number of observed variables that are associated with help-seeking behaviour.

- They develop a set of questions to capture these variables, such as:

    - "I would feel ashamed if I had a mental health problem."
    - "I would feel comfortable talking to my friends about my mental health problems."
    - "I would feel comfortable talking to my family about my mental health problems."
    - "I would feel comfortable talking to a mental health professional about my mental health problems."
    - "I have the skills to manage my mental health problems."
    - "My symptoms are severe."

## Example 2: Research questions involving latent variables {.smaller}

- The researcher then uses factor analysis to identify the latent variables that explain the relationships between the observed variables.

- The analysis indicates two groups of questions that are highly correlated. The researcher labels these groups as "stigma" and "self-efficacy", based on which observed variables that are included in each group.


# Exploratory factor analysis

## Exploratory Factor analysis 


- Identify the relational structure between a set of variables in order to reduce them to a smaller set of factors
  - The process of **dimension reduction** (identify new variables) or **data summarisation** (summarise what is already there)

- The researcher does not have a pre-specified model 

## Dimension reduction (factor analysis)

- **Latent Variables**: Not directly observable. Rather they are inferred from other responses
  - Many psychological constructs (e.g. anxiety) are latent variables that we cannot directly measure. 
  - Rather, we can measure behaviours, cognitions and other variables that are related to the construct.

> We might concptualise this as: "Responses to the questions are indicative of levels of underlying anxiety"



## Data summarisation (principal component analysis)

- **Index Variables** or **Components**: A weighted summary of measured variables that contribute to the component variable

- "Principal components are variables of maximal variance constructed from linear combinations of the input features"

> We might conceptualise this as: "We can reduce these measures/questions to a smaller set of higher order, independent, composite variables"  

## Latent versus index variables

**Latent Variables** are causes of their indicators: changes in Anxiety (indicator) leads to increased frequency of negative cognitions (measure).

**Index Variables** are effects of their indicators: change in cholesterol level (indicator) will change QRISK score (index measure).

> Altering the indicators of an index changes the definition of the variable being indexed (because the index is a calculation of the indicators). This is not the case with a latent variable.  




## Types of exploratory factor analysis

There are two common methods of exploratory factor analysis: **Common Factor analysis** and **Principal Component Analysis**

- CFA looks for latent variables that explain the correlations between observed variables

- PCA looks for index variables that explain the correlations between observed variables

## Variance in exploratory factor analysis

- CFA assumes that there are two types of variance: common and unique

```{r  out.width = "90%", echo=F}

knitr::include_graphics("img/cfavariance.png") 
```


## Variance in exploratory factor analysis

- PCA only assumes common variance


```{r  out.width = "100%", echo=F}

knitr::include_graphics("img/pcavariance.png") 
```

## Variance in exploratory factor analysis


```{r  out.width = "200%", echo=F}

knitr::include_graphics("img/pcafa1.png") 
```

## Which type of exploratory factor analysis?


- Due to these different approaches, PCA is considered to be reflective of the current sample but not generalisable to the wider population

- Whereas, CFA is considered appropriate for hypothesis testing and making inferences to the population


# What is factor analysis?

## What is factor analysis?

- If we measure several variables (or questions), we can examine the correlation between sets of these variables
  - Such a correlation matrix is known as an **R Matrix** (*r* because correlation)
- If there are clusters of correlations between a number of the variables (or questions), this indicates that they might be linked to the same underlying dimension (or latent variable)
- The researcher should use informed judgement when assessing the appropriateness of variables for inclusion

```
An r matrix example

## Considerations with factor analysis {.smaller}

- Sample size: 
  - Must be more data points than variables being measured
  - A common rule of thumb is at least 10 per variable
  - There are tests to assess sample size adequacy (e.g. Kaiser-Meyer test should be greater than 0.5)

- Inter-correlation:
  - There must be sufficient correlation between the variables being measured
  - A high number of correlations over 0.3
  - Can be tested using Bartlett test of sphericity (sig. result means factor analysis can be used)
  
## Other things to check (see Field, 2018)  

- The quality of analysis depends upon the quality of the data (GI=GO).
- Avoid multicollinearity:
  - several variables highly correlated, r > .80.
  - Determinent: should be greater than 0.00001
- Avoid singularity:
  - some variables perfectly correlated, r = 1.
- Screen the correlation matrix, eliminate any variables that obviously cause concern.


## Representing factor analysis {.smaller}

> We can represent factors visually based on the strength of their inter-correlations 
- Here, the axis of the graph represents a factor or latent variable

```{r  out.width = "100%", echo=F}
#| layout-ncol: 2

knitr::include_graphics("img/efaplot.png") 
```

## Representing factor analysis

> We can also represent factor analysis using a regression equation
- Here the beta values represent the extent to which the variable "loads onto" a particular factor

```{r  out.width = "100%", echo=F}
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| column: screen-inset

knitr::include_graphics("img/efaeq1.png") 


```

```{r  out.width = "100%", echo=F}
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| column: screen-inset

knitr::include_graphics("img/efaeq2.png") 


```

## Factor Analysis Example: Statistics anxiety


- Many people get anxious about statistics
- We can ask them about their experience in a number of ways (e.g. questions compiled by students in a stats class)

- Their responses might indicate that stats anxiety has a number of dimensions
  - i.e. it is a multi-dimensional construct, as opposed to a unitary construct

## Factor Analysis Example: Statistics anxiety

```{r  out.height = "100%", echo=F}

knitr::include_graphics("img/raq.png") 
```

## Step 1: Create a correlation matrix

```{r}
raq.matrix <- cor(raq)

raq.matrix

```

## Step 2: Let's check for Inter-correlation <good>



```{r}

library(corrplot)
corrplot(raq.matrix, method = "number")
```

## Step 2: Let's check for Inter-correlation <good>

- We can use bartlett's test from the psych package

```{r}
library(psych)

cortest.bartlett(raq.matrix, n=2571)
```


## Step 3: Check sampling adequacy

- Overall should be > 0.5

```{r}
KMO(raq)
```

## Step 4: Identify number of factors


- Based on Eigenvalues:
    - Kaiser (1960) – retain factors with eigen values > 1.
    - Joliffe (1972) – retain factors with eigen values > .70. 

-  Use a scree plot: Cattell (1966): use ‘point of inflexion’. 

## Which rule?
- Use Kaiser’s extraction when
  - Less than 30 variables, communalities after extraction > 0.7
  - Sample size > 250 and mean communality ≥ 0.6
- Scree plot is good if sample size is > 200

## Scree plot {.smaller}


```{r}
scree(raq)
```


- We are looking for the point of inflection
- Where there is a drop-off

> One approach:
> See how many factors we can draw a line through



## Step 4: Identify number of factors

> How many dimensions of stats anxiety are captured in the questionnaire?

- We can run a **parallel analysis** to get an indication of the number of factors contained within the data
- Parallel Analysis:
   - Simulates data within the same range of values as our data set
   - Suggests that we retain, at maximum, the factors with eigenvalues larger than those extracted from simulated data.

##

```{r  out.height = "100%", echo=F}

knitr::include_graphics("img/raq.png") 

```


## Step 4: Identify number of factors


```{r}
library(psych)

 parallel_analysis <- fa.parallel(raq)

 parallel_analysis

```



## Step 5: Perform factor analysis (with initial recommended # factors) {.smaller .scrollable}

```{r}
paf <- fa(raq,
nfactors = 6,
fm="pa",
max.iter = 100,
rotate = "none")

paf

```

## What does the output tell us?: Loadings {.smaller}

- MR, ML and PC are different methods of fitting factor analysis

- h2 is the communality of each variable (i.e. the proportion of variance in each variable that is explained by the factors)

- u2 is the uniqueness of each variable (i.e. the proportion of variance in each variable that is not explained by the factors)

- The higher the h2, the better the variable is represented by the factors

- com is the item complexity (i.e. the number of factors that each variable loads onto)


## {.smaller .scrollable}



```{r}
paf <- fa(raq,
nfactors = 6,
fm="pa",
max.iter = 100,
rotate = "none")

paf

```

## What does the output tell us?: variance explained {.smaller}

- SS loadings is the  Eigenvalue (i.e. the proportion of variance in each variable that is explained by the factors)

- Proportion Var is the proportion of variance the factor explains

- Cumulative Var is the cumulative proportion of variance explained by the factor

- Proportion Explained is the relative proportion of variance explained by the factor (of the total variance explained by all factors)

- Cumulative Proportion is the cumulative proportion of variance explained by the factor (of the total variance explained by all factors)


## {.smaller .scrollable}

```{r}
paf <- fa(raq,
nfactors = 6,
fm="pa",
max.iter = 100,
rotate = "none")

paf

```

## What does the output tell us?: Model Significance {.smaller }

- Chi.sq is the chi-square statistic for the model

- It is displayed in the line: *The total n.obs was  2571  with Likelihood Chi Square =  578.65  with prob <  7.6e-58* 

## Evaluating a model {.smaller}

- The overall model significance is assessed using the chi-square statistic

- The eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance explained by each factor

- The AIC and BIC are used to compare different models (lower values are better)

- The RMSEA is a measure of model fit (lower values are better)

## Testing a model model with reduced number of factors {.smaller .scrollable}

```{r}
paf1 <- fa(raq,
nfactors = 2,
fm="pa",
max.iter = 100,
rotate = "none")

paf1



```

## 

```{r}
plot(paf1)
```


# Factor analysis rotation

## What is rotation?
- It is possible that variables load "highly" onto one factor and "medium" onto another
- By rotating the factor axes, the variables are aligned with the factors that they load onto most
- This helps us  discriminate between factors

## There are different methods of rotation
- **Orthogonal rotation:** Assumes that factors are unrelated and keeps them that way
- **Oblique rotation:** Assumes that factors might be related and allows them to be correlated after rotation

> ### Are factors related?
> -Theoretical: Do we have logical reason for thinking they could be connected?

> -Based on data: Does the factor plot suggest independence or relatedness?


## Step 7: Rotation {.smaller .scrollable}

 - Perform factor analysis (with rotation)

```{r}
paf2 <- fa(raq,
nfactors = 2,
fm="pa",
max.iter = 100,
rotate = "oblimin") ## oblimin is oblique rotation

paf2

```


## Step 7: Rotation

```{r}
plot(paf1)


```

## Step 7: Rotation
```{r}
plot(paf2)
```


# Reporting factor analysis

## Reporting factor analysis

The researcher should report:

-  the number of factors that were extracted

-  the method of extraction and rotation

- A table of factor loadings
