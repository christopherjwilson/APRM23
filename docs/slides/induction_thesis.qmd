# Approaching Research Methods 1

## What is Research Methods 1 about?

- The module is roughly split into two parts: qualitative and quantitative research methods.

- The sessions are about general clinical research methods, but developed with consideration to how they apply to your thesis project.

## Structure of the quantitative sessions

- Sessions will be a mixture of lectures and practicals.

- There is information on Blackboard about the focus of each session.

- For the lectures, there is associated reading.

- For the practicals, you can prepare using the material on the [ https://christopherjwilson.github.io/APRM23/]( https://christopherjwilson.github.io/APRM23/) website.

## Adopting a growth mindset

- Learning a new tool, like R and R Studio, will be challenging.

- This is something that will take time and practice.

- You will need to be patient with yourself.

- For the purposes of this year, we need you to focus on understanding the concepts, rather than becoming an expert in R.

# Thesis development

## Building a rationale from the literature

- Regardless of the source of your thesis project idea, you will need to develop a thorough rationale for your project, based on the literature.

- This is a fundamental part of the thesis development process.

- In this sense, consider reviewing the literature as an active process, rather than a passive one.

> The biggest question is: "Why is this project important and what does it add?"

## Research doesn't happen in big chunks of time

- Research is a process that happens with ongoing engagement.

- Conceptual connections between theories, frameworks, and ideas are made over time.

- Engage with your supervisor regularly, and make notes of how your ideas develop and change over time.

> You should always know what you are working towards. If not, meet with your supervisor.

## Use tools to help you

Tools for storing and organising your research (choose one):

- Zotero
- Mendeley
- Papers
- Paperpile

They are more than just reference managers:

- They can help you organise your research
- They can help you develop your ideas
- They can help you speed up the writing process
